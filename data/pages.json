It is very important to play the game in accordance with the \nlaws and be mindful of player welfare at all times. \nIt is the responsibility of players to ensure that they are physically and \ntechnically prepared to play within the laws and are committed to participate in \naccordance with safe practices and enjoyment.\nIt is the responsibility of those who coach or teach the game to ensure that \nplayers are prepared to comply with the laws, to play fairly and practice safe \nconduct. \nIt is the duty of the referee to apply fairly all the laws in every match, including law \ntrials and variations as authorised by World Rugby  .\nIt is the duty of the unions to ensure that the game at every level is conducted in \naccordance with disciplined and sporting behaviour  . \nThe principle of fair play cannot be upheld solely by the referee  . Responsibility for its \nobservance also rests on unions, clubs, other affiliated bodies, coaches and players .\nEach union should create a pathway programme for youth players .  Through this \nprogramme, young players can be gradually introduced to the various phases of \nrugby at an appropriate time, offering them more protection from injury  . The age \nand content of this programme should be determined by each union, depending on \nthe unique characteristics of the playing environment within that union .\n3\nLAWS OF THE GAME RUGBY UNION 2024FOREWORD", "Playing \ncharter", "INTRODUCTION\nA game which started out as a simple pastime has been transformed into \na global network around which vast stadia have been built, an intricate \nadministrative structure created and complex strategies devised. Rugby \nunion, in common with any activity which attracts the interest and enthusiasm \nof all kinds of people, has many sides and faces.\nRugby is played worldwide by people of all ages from across a wide and diverse \nrange of backgrounds .  More than 8 . 5 million people aged from six to 60+ regularly \nparticipate in the playing of the game  . The wide variation of skills and physical \nrequirements needed for the game mean that there is an opportunity for individuals \nof every shape, size and ability to participate  .\nApart from the playing of the game and its ancillary support, rugby embraces a \nnumber of social and emotional concepts such as courage, loyalty, sportsmanship, \ndiscipline and teamwork  . What this charter does is to give the game a checklist \nagainst which the mode of play and behaviour can be assessed .  The objective is to \nensure that rugby maintains its unique character both on and off the field .\nThe charter covers the basic principles of rugby as they relate to playing and \ncoaching, and to the creation and application of the laws .  It is hoped that the \ncharter, which is an important complement to the laws, will set the standards for all \nthose who are involved in rugby, at whatever level  .\nINTEGRITY \u2022 PASSION \u2022 SOLIDARITY  \nDISCIPLINE \u2022 RESPECT\n5\nLAWS OF THE GAME RUGBY UNION 2024PLAYING CHARTER", "CONDUCT\nThe legend of William Webb Ellis, who is credited with first picking up the football \nand running with it, has doggedly survived the countless revisionist theories since \nthat day at Rugby School in 1823 .  That the game should have its origins in an act of \nspirited defiance is somehow appropriate  .\nAt first glance it is difficult to find the guiding principles behind a game which, to the \ncasual observer, appears to be a mass of contradictions .  It is perfectly acceptable, \nfor example, to be seen to be exerting extreme physical pressure on an opponent \nin an attempt to gain possession of the ball, but not wilfully or maliciously to inflict \ninjury  .\nThese are the boundaries within which players and referees must operate and it is \nthe capacity to make this fine distinction, combined with control and discipline, both \nindividual and collective, upon which the code of conduct depends .  \nSPIRIT\nRugby owes much of its appeal to the fact that it is played both to the letter and \nwithin the spirit of the laws .  The responsibility for ensuring that this happens lies not \nwith one individual\u00a0-\u00a0it involves coaches, captains, players and referees .PRINCIPLES OF THE GAME\nWORLD RUGBY\n6PLAYING CHARTER", "Integrity is central to the fabric of the game and is generated \nthrough honesty and fair playINTEGRITY", "It is through discipline, control and mutual respect that the spirit of the game \nflourishes and, in the context of a game as physically challenging as rugby, these \nare the qualities which forge the fellowship and sense of fair play so essential to the \ngame\u2019s ongoing success and survival  .\nOld-fashioned traditions and virtues they may be, but they have stood the test of \ntime and, at all levels at which the game is played, they remain as important to \nrugby\u2019s future as they have been throughout its long and distinguished past .  The \nprinciples of rugby are the fundamental elements upon which the game is based \nand they enable participants to immediately identify the game\u2019s character and what \nmakes it distinctive as a sport .\nOBJECT\nThe game\u2019s objective is to score as many points as possible against an opposing \nteam by carrying, passing, kicking and grounding the ball, according to the laws of \nthe game, its sporting spirit and fair play  .\nCONTEST AND CONTINUITY\nThe contest for possession of the ball is one of rugby\u2019s key features .  These contests \noccur throughout the game and in a number of different forms: \n\u2022 in contact\n\u2022 in open play\n\u2022 when play is re-started at scrums, lineouts, kick-offs and restart kicks .PRINCIPLES OF THE GAME\nWORLD RUGBY\n8PLAYING CHARTER", "Rugby people have a passionate enthusiasm for the game. \nRugby generates excitement, emotional attachment and a \nsense of belonging to the global rugby familyPASSION", "The contests are balanced in such a way as to reward superior skill displayed in \nthe preceding action .  For example, a team forced to kick for touch because of its \ninability to maintain the play is denied the throw-in to the lineout .  Similarly, the \nteam knocking the ball on or passing the ball forward is denied the throw at the \nsubsequent scrum .  The advantage then must always lie with the team throwing \nthe ball in, although, here again, it is important that these areas of play can be fairly \ncontested .\nThe team in possession aims to maintain continuity by denying the opposition the \nball and, by skilful means, to advance and score points .  Failure to do this will mean \nthe surrendering of possession to the opposition either as a result of shortcomings \non the part of the team in possession or because of the quality of the opposition \ndefence; contest and continuity, profit and loss .\nAs one team attempts to maintain continuity of possession, the opposing team \nstrives to contest for possession .  This provides the essential balance between \ncontinuity of play and continuity of possession .  This balance of contestability and \ncontinuity applies to both set piece and open play  .PRINCIPLES OF THE GAME\nWORLD RUGBY\n10PLAYING CHARTER", "Rugby provides a unifying spirit that leads to life long \nfriendships, camaraderie, teamwork and loyalty which transcends \ncultural, geographic, political and religious differencesSOLIDARITY", "The principles upon which the laws of the game are based are:\nA SPORT FOR ALL\nThe laws provide players of different physiques, skills, genders and ages with the \nopportunity to participate at their levels of ability in a controlled, competitive and \nenjoyable environment .  It is incumbent upon all who play rugby to have a thorough \nknowledge and understanding of the laws of the game  .\nMAINTAINING THE IDENTITY\nThe laws ensure that rugby\u2019s distinctive features are maintained through scrums, \nlineouts, mauls, rucks, kick-offs and re-starts .  Also the key features relating to \ncontest and continuity\u00a0-\u00a0the backward pass, the offensive tackle  .\nENJOYMENT AND ENTERTAINMENT\nThe laws provide the framework for a game that is both enjoyable to play and \nentertaining to watch .  If, on occasions, these objectives appear to be incompatible, \nenjoyment and entertainment are enhanced by enabling the players to give full rein \nto their skills .  To achieve the correct balance, the laws are constantly under review  .\nAPPLICATION\nThere is an over-riding obligation on the players to observe the laws and to respect \nthe principles of fair play  . The laws must be applied in such a way as to ensure \nthat the game is played according to the principles of play  . The match officials \ncan achieve this through fairness, consistency, sensitivity and, when appropriate, \nmanagement .  In return, it is the responsibility of coaches, captains and players to \nrespect the authority of the match officials .PRINCIPLES OF THE LAWS\nWORLD RUGBY\n12PLAYING CHARTER", "Discipline is an integral part of the game, both on and off \nthe field, and is reflected through adherence to the laws, the \nregulations and rugby\u2019s core valuesDISCIPLINE", "Rugby is valued as a sport for all. It builds teamwork, understanding, co-operation \nand respect for fellow participants. Its cornerstones are, as they always have been: \n\u2022 The pleasure of participating\n\u2022 The courage and skill which the game demands\n\u2022 The love of a team sport that enriches the lives of all involved\n\u2022 The lifelong friendships forged through a shared interest in the game.\nIt is because of, not despite, rugby\u2019s intensely physical and athletic characteristics \nthat such great camaraderie exists before and after matches. The long-standing \ntradition of players from competing teams enjoying each other\u2019s company away \nfrom the pitch and in a social context remains at the very core of the game.\nRugby has fully embraced the professional era, but has retained the ethos and \ntraditions of the recreational game. In an age in which many traditional sporting \nqualities are being diluted or even challenged, rugby is rightly proud of its ability to \nretain high standards of sportsmanship, ethical behaviour and fair play.\nThis charter will help to reinforce those cherished values.CONCLUSION\nWORLD RUGBY\n14PLAYING CHARTER", "Respect for team-mates, opponents, match officials and those \ninvolved in the game is paramountRESPECT", "DIAGRAMS\nThroughout this book, the diagrams conform to the following conventions:\nPlayers\nBall\nPath of ball when kicked\nPath of ball when thrown / passed\nPath of ball when knocked on / charged down\nPath of player\nFlag post\nTEXT\nOngoing Global Law Trials are denoted by:\nSanctions are denoted by colour as follows:\nRed for a sanction which results in the award of a penalty\nGreen for a sanction which results in the award of a free-kick\nBlue for a sanction which results in the award of a scrum, restart kick, quick-throw \nor lineout\nGold for a sanction which results in the disallowing of a kick  .\nWORLD RUGBY\n16KEY TO TEXT AND DIAGRAMS", "Definitions", "0-9\n22:  The area between the goal line and the 22-metre line, and between the \ntouchlines .
